Does this code work exactly as described?
I can not get it to work with the quotes.
I can get it to work if I remove the quotes.
Way too much time was spent debugging trying to figure out why my Blogs code was failing because variables were empty. 
I'm a very frustrated camper on this one :)

// just create an object
new Session();

$f3->set('SESSION.test',123);
echo $f3->get('SESSION.test');
